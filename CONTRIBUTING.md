## Coding Rules

To keep the code base of commitlint neat and tidy the following rules apply to every change

- `prettier` is king
- `eslint` is awesome
- Favor micro library over swiss army knives (rimraf, ncp vs. fs-extra)
- Be awesome

> use commands `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` to be sure your code
> respect coding rules.

> You can also use `npx prettier --write .` to fix prettier errors

## Commit Rules

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of commitlint the following commit rules are enforced.

- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
- present tense
- maximum of 100 characters
- for bugs, includes the github tag of the issue in the description.
- message format of `$type($scope): $message`
- use authorized types: build, ci, chore, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test

> Using the right type is really important since it is used to increase the version number automatically.

## Test

If you add a feature or fix a bug, you need to provide a unit test verifying your
improvement.You can launch tests using `pnpm test`.

Please follow [AAA pattern](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/title-testing-code-ocd-and-the-aaa-pattern-df453975ab80)
when writing tests.

## Versioning

This project use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to handle versioning
automatically.

**May the force be with you !!**
