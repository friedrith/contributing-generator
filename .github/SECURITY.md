# Security Policy

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through my organizations.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our products, you can report it to me using the following methods:

- Report it to this repository directly using [private vulnerability reporting][https://github.com/friedrith/contributing-generator/security/advisories]. Such reports are not eligible for a bounty reward.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Thanks for helping make contributing-generator safe for everyone.
