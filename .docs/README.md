# Gif generator

In order to maintain the gif visible in the README up to date, we must regenerate it every time we add new feature.

## How to update the gif

1. Update the file `demo.yml` with the new commands to run the generator.
2. Install [terminalizer](https://www.terminalizer.com/)
3. Run command `terminalizer render demo -o demo.gif` to generate the gif.
4. Upload the gif in a github issue
5. Copy the link to the README.md file.
